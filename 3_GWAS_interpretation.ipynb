    "The red dotted line in the Manhattan plot marks the Bonferroni significance cutoff. Since we perform so many tests in a GWAS (one per SNP), we need to apply a method to correct the p-value threshold so we don't identify too many false positive SNPs. The easiest method is the Bonferroni correction, which is done by dividing a typical significance threshold (usually 0.05) by the number of tests done (i.e. the number of SNPs tested). SNPs above the dotted line in this Manhattan plot would be significant above the Bonferroni cutoff.  There are none in the case of our subset flowering time GWAS!\n",

Testing these SNPs therefore adds to our multiple testing correction problem without giving us much useful information in return.\n",
